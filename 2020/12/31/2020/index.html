As the title suggests, I would like to look back on 2020 briefly.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<h2 id="Early-2020"><a href="#Early-2020" class="headerlink" title="Early 2020"></a>Early 2020</h2><p>I started writing this blog. At that time, I was doing my graduation research on text-to-speech with emotions at a technical college, and I was struggling to get good results. In an attempt to output some of the results, I started posting articles on solving kaggle using the machine learning knowledge which I had learned in a process the research. Although I felt a sense of accomplishment when I posted articles, I was so stuck in my graduation research that I didn’t go to school much anymore. I drank alcohol every day to lift my depressed mood. Looking back now, these days were the worst for me in many ways.</p>
<h2 id="Mid-2020"><a href="#Mid-2020" class="headerlink" title="Mid 2020"></a>Mid 2020</h2><p>I entered university, but mind hadn’t cleared up at all since my graduation project. I wasn’t very motivated to go to school, but all my classes were online, so I was able to attend. I didn’t have any friends on campus, so I spent most of my time talking with a transfered student and my friends from the technical college. Fortunately, I he was a good person. The internship also fluctuated a lot, being cancelled and going online. I participated in my first online internship. I thought, “I can do it online!” At the time, but now I think  it’s better to do it offline.<br>The first time I made on-campus friends was at a hackathon in July. With this opportunity, I joined an IT circle and gradually made more friends. I participated in isucon10 with the people I met in the sago circle. (The result was not good.) After the hackathon, I felt like my mood was improving, but I started to feel depressed again, as if my mood is cyclical. It was around this time that I began to visit a psychosomatic department.</p>
<h2 id="Late-2020"><a href="#Late-2020" class="headerlink" title="Late 2020"></a>Late 2020</h2><p>I participated in the Discovery Hackathon and JPhacks. Although the results of both events were not so good,but it was great to be able to create something with my friends. In my personal development, I tend to do master push, but after this experience, I have started to make issues and create branches even in my personal development (I should have done this in the past). Some offline classes started, I got part-time technical jobs, and I was able to interact with more people than I could have imagined in April this year. I was able to join an NLP-related lab as I had hoped, and I was able to deepen my relationships with the senior membors.</p>
<p>In the past year, I have been able to post 18 articles every month, which is an excellent for me.I also had a lot of opportunities to use React and Go, which helped me grow technically. My mood has been improving lately, and I would like to continue to do my best in many ways at this rate.</p>
<p>In 2021, I want to try to write a blog with more content.</p>
<p>Have a great rest of the year.</p>
